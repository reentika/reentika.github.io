        <h3>An Endless Month Filled with Learning & Celebrations</h3>
        <br>
          <p>The end of April, I began a goal I had been wanting to complete since I was in Grade 10, and that was a website!
             I embarked on the journey to create a website from scratch, and finally made it!
              Along the way, I decided to make it even more personal by making it 
              <strong>Netflix-themed</strong>. One of my goals is to work at Netflix one day. 
              This came from my love for cinema, and TV shows when I started recognizing how well 
              the algorithm worked for me in recommending me TV shows/movies.</p> <br>

          <p>This was probably my busiest month of the year. From painting the walls of my new house, to graduating from the cadet program, and volunteering at a conference. It was <strong>VERY</strong> hectic.</p><br>

          <h3>From One Wall to the Whole Houseâ€¦</h3>
          <p>What started as a simple mission between my sister and me â€” just repainting our bedroom walls â€” quickly turned into a full-house makeover. After moving into a new home, we noticed scuff marks and patches on the walls and thought, why not freshen things up a bit? I had some free time, and after binging way too many ASMR painting videos, I figured this was the perfect moment to channel that energy into something productive.</p>
          <br>
          <p>After we painted our first wall white, we got <em>way</em> too confident. Next thing you know, we were experimenting with colors, textures, and even wallpapers. Our DIY painting project spiraled into a two-week adventure. And though it took a surprising amount of effort, sweat, and trial-and-error (seriously â€” wallpaper is not as easy as it looks), we wrapped it up with a real sense of accomplishment.</p>
          <br>

              alt="before" 
              style="display: inline-block; height: 300px; width: auto; margin: 0.5em; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 6px; vertical-align: middle;"

              style="display: inline-block; height: 300px; width: auto; margin: 0.5em; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 6px; vertical-align: middle;"
            >

            <p style= "center; margin-top: 0.5em;">
              <em style="color:white;">Before & After of my room - still not complete BTW!</em>
            </p>
            <br>
          </div>
          
          
          
      

          <p>You might be wondering why take on a project like this in my only three weeks off before summer school? The truth is, I thrive when Iâ€™m busy. Thereâ€™s so much to learn, create, and experience. And I believe if you can take initiative on the small things, you build the mindset and to take on bigger ones too.</p>
          <br>
          <p>So, if youâ€™ve been thinking about repainting your room; <em>just go for it.</em> Use the resources availble, spend a little, and make something your own. <strong>Itâ€™s worth it. ðŸ™‚</strong></p>
          
          <br><hr><br>
          <h3>Sylvie Brought Me Water</h3>
          <p>In the middle of all the house chaos, <strong>I officially aged out of the cadet program!</strong> I joined back in October 2019 as a shy 13-year-old, unsure of what I was getting into, fueled by my fatherâ€™s passion from the Indian Navy. And now, after years of showing up, learning, and growing, <strong>I can say with confidence: I got so much out of it.</strong></p>
          <br>

            <em style="color:white;">Getting my mug!</em>
          </p>
          <br>

          <p>The cadet program truly has something for everyone. It took me a while to find what I loved most and to be honest, <strong>I will ALWAYS wish I had explored even more.</strong> But with the opportunities I did take, Iâ€™m incredibly proud. By the end, I earned the rank of <strong>CPO2</strong> and contributed to my corps in meaningful ways, especially through social media. The weeks I spent at <strong>HMCS Quadra</strong> as a Petty Officer of Professional Development at camp were truly unforgettable. Someday, Iâ€™d love to go back and womp-womp with my friends and beg sylvie for water ðŸ˜‰</p>
          <br>
          <p>I met amazing friends, gained real-life skills, and created memories Iâ€™ll always hold close. If you're in the program (or thinking of joining), I hope you make the most of it. <strong>Show up. Stay curious. Itâ€™s worth it.</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>And of course, a huge shoutout to my second favorite dessert spot, <strong>Chocolate Favoris</strong>, for opening just in time on May 3rd and being the perfect place to celebrate my age-out. <em>Love you forever!</em></p>

          <h3>CCECE or a Eating Week</h3>
          <p>To end an already eventful month, I volunteered at the <strong>Canadian Conference for Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)</strong> hosted by IEEE and honestly, <strong>it was one of the best experiences of my life.</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>Sure, the endless supply of warm scones, ice-cold Coca-Colas, and amazing food didnâ€™t hurt but what made it truly unforgettable was that it gave me <strong>my first real glimpse into the professional world of my industry.</strong> It was the moment everything Iâ€™ve been studying started to feel worth it.</p>
          <br>

          </p>
          <br>

          <p><strong>Hereâ€™s what the experience taught me, straight from my chaotic Notes app</strong> (decipher at your own risk):</p>
          <br>
          <blockquote>
            Today is the last day i am volunteering at the CCECC 2025 conference. apart from being carefully taken care of and well fed, this was probably one of my favorite things iâ€™ve ever done.  
            
            It was th best learning opportunity for me. I have learned so much by attending just a couple of events.  

            In the mentorship forum:  
            <ul style="padding-left: 2rem;">
              <li>met two icons (dr ward, ms simay)</li>
              <li>rekindled passion for solar energy</li>
              <li>women can do everything</li>
              <li>masters is best learned after working - DO TO LEARN, then learn again = stores better. regardless of study habits</li>
              <li>you can do anything - man made  prosthetic leg for his son!</li>
              <li>thereâ€™s so much to engineering from phd to professor to industry to consulting to entrepreneurship, letâ€™s find me calling</li>
            </ul>
            
            <strong>GALA EVENT:</strong>
            <ul style="padding-left: 2rem;">
              <li>amazing service work, papers i will never understand but motivated individuals</li>
              <li>age is just a number - duff jones: going back to school at 33 to go a complete switch in careers and being successful in each way</li>
            </ul>
            
            <strong>WOMEN IN ENGINEERJNG PANEL:</strong>
            <ul style="padding-left: 2rem;">
              <li>people come from different backgrounds with fat too many obstacles yet still excel</li>
              <li>UBC engineering traditions are crazy (Lady Godiva)</li>
              <li>dr ward is a true icon</li>
            </ul> 
          </blockquote>
          <br>
          <p>But through these events the most important thing I got was <strong>MOTIVATION.</strong> Motivation to do something, somethiny good and aomething of my own. And it canâ€™t just be anything, it should be something I love and am passionate about, because do = learn.</p>
          <br>
          <p>As a first year student that passion dies down becuz of how stressful the workload is and im sure everyone can agreee. but this gave me a oook into being successful and doing something while also contributing to my field in different ways by being involved in things like IEEE.</p>
          <br>
          <p>So now, itâ€™s time to begin working on my own projects and doing things that help people, already my mind is generating ideas - be it good or not.</p>
          <br><hr><br>
          <h4>And while those were my most significant learning eventsâ€¦</h4>
          <p>I canâ€™t forget to include the celebrations that happened along the way. <strong>Happy Motherâ€™s Day to my amazing mommy</strong>, and <strong> happy graduation to my sister</strong>. It was a great month!</p>
